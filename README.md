# COVID-19 Mortality Rate Analysis

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges worldwide, and vaccinations have been recognized as one of the most effective strategies to combat the virus. This project aims to analyze the COVID-19 vaccination rate in Asia, with a particular emphasis on the number of individuals who are fully, partially, or not vaccinated, based on a dataset obtained through SQL queries.

Using Tableau, interactive visualizations were developed, providing a user-friendly and informative platform for exploring COVID-19 vaccination rates across Asia. Furthermore, the project explores the correlation between GDP per capita and vaccination rates, employing interactive visualizations such as graphs.

The insights obtained from this project offer crucial information for policymakers, public health officials, and the general public, assisting them in comprehending the progress and obstacles encountered in COVID-19 vaccination efforts across Asia.
