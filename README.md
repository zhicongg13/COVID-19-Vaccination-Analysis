# COVID-19 Mortality Rate Analysis

This project was based on a dataset queried using SQL, which allowed for the extraction and analysis of COVID-19 mortality data. The data was then used to create interactive visualisations on Tableau, providing a user-friendly and informative platform for exploring COVID-19 mortality rates worldwide. The estimated mortality rate for 2023 was calculated based on past data trends, providing valuable insights into the potential future impact of the pandemic.
